			<h1>ddDrumr</h1>
			<p>ddDrumr is drum machine application written in html/css/ javascript/jquery.
			It's developed by the developer community <a
			href="http://daladevelop.se">Daladevelop</a>.
			Originally it was intended to be a contender in the <a
			href="http://10k.aneventapart.com">10k Apart 2011</a> contest
			but the fact that it uses audio files meant that the 10k limit was quickly
			passed.</p>
			<h2>People</h2>
			<p>Concept, development and design: <a
			href="http://twitter.com/mikaeljorhult">Mikael Jorhult</a>, <a 
			href="http://twitter.com/emomilol">Emil Ã–sterlund</a> and <a 
			href="http://twitter.com/synvila">Henrik Carlsson</a>.</p>
			<h2>How do I rock it? </h2>
			<p>It's basically a step sequencer. If you're not a music geek, what I just said was that
			the different rows represents different sounds, and the columns different points in time.
			If a square is clicked(yellow) a sound will play when the timeline moves over it.
			Thus you can have different rhythms made. </p>
			<h2>And this SoundCloud-thing, what's that?</h2>
			<p>Oh that, well, just for fun! SoundCloud is a web service where people upload their music.
			Kind of like MySpace, except it's great.
			If you click "Load songs from SoundCloud" ddDrumr will <em>TRY</em> to get a capella songs
			(songs without instruments) from the BPM range your ddDrumr pattern is currently rocking in.
			That makes you able to put a human voice on your machine beat. Most often this sounds rather
			crappy, but we thought, heck it's fun, why not include it? Try it out and experiment! </p>
			<h2>Browser support?</h2>
			<p>Every one of course! Yes, we fully expect you to show up here with Internet Explorer 3.5
			installed and has taken every possible measure to make it a smooth ride.</p>
			<p><em>Well duh!</em> This little experiment relies on modern techniques so off course you
			will need a modern browser. Currently up to date versions of Chrome and Safari works best,
			but other modern browsers (IE9, FF5) will likely work in most cases, though not perfect.</p>
