			<h1>ddDrumr</h1>
			<p>ddDrumr is drum machine application written in html/css/ javascript/jquery.
			It's developed by the developer community <a
			href="http://daladevelop.se">Daladevelop</a>.
			Originally it was intended to be a contender in the <a
			href="http://10k.aneventapart.com">10k Apart 2011</a> contest
			but the fact that it uses audio files meant the 10k limit was quickly
			passed.</p>
			<h2>People</h2>
			<p>Concept, development and design: <a
			href="http://twitter.com/mikaeljorhult">Mikael Jorhult</a>, <a 
			href="http://twitter.com/emomilol">Emil Ã–sterlund</a> and <a 
			href="http://twitter.com/synvila">Henrik Carlsson</a>.</p>
			<h2>How do i rock it? </h2>
			<p>All the different rows visualize different sounds. If a square is clicked(yellow) a sound will play when the timeline moves over it. Thus you can have different rythms made. </p>
			<h2>And this soundcloudthing, whats that?</h2>
			<p>Oh that, well, just for fun if you grab songs from soundcloud it will <em>TRY</em> to get acapella songs(songs without instruments) from the bpm range your dddrumr is currently rocking in. That makes you able to put a singing sound upon it. Most often this sounds rather crapyp, but we thought, hell its also a great bit of fun. Try it out and experiment! </p>
			<h2>Whats the browsersupport for this!??</h2>
			<p>Oh thats a long story. Shortly we can say it works great on newer(newest??) versions of Chrome. Chromium and firefox does not want to play the mp3 stream soundcloud gives upon streaming. Internet explorer has some support but not perfect. </p>
